# Sustainable Practices within Visualization and Physicalization

We invite you to join the [IEEEVIS 2024](https://ieeevis.org/year/2024/welcome) Workshop on VISions of the Future: Sustainable Practices within Visualization and Physicalization. This workshop will weave together two disparate strands of ‘what can visualization do for climate research’ and ‘what can sustainability research teach the field of visualization’ into a coherent sustainability agenda for the field of Visualization broadly. The aim is to facilitate a space for researchers to collectively reflect on futures where the research and practice of Visualization harmoniously integrate with the Earth and its ecology.

### Visualizing Post-growth Futures

Neha Kumar is an Associate Professor at the School of Interactive Computing at Georgia Tech. Her research lies at the intersection of human-computer interaction and global development, with a focus on global health and community informatics. Her work contributes feminist perspectives to the design and integration of emerging technologies across marginalized contexts in the Global South. Her research has been recognized by multiple ACM Best Paper and Honorable Mention awards. She currently serves as the President of ACM SIGCHI and as the Chair of the ACM SIG Governing Board. She earned her Ph.D. in Information Management Systems from UC Berkeley, Master’s degrees in Computer Science and Education from Stanford University, and Bachelor’s in Computer Science and Applied Math from UC Berkeley.

## ~~Submission Details (submission past)~~

We invite submission of research papers, pictorials, and provocations between 2 and 4 pages long in the [standard VIS submission format](https://tc.computer.org/vgtc/publications/conference/), excluding references, with length commensurate with content. Relevant topics might include: interrogations into the sustainability of the relationship between the academic and practitioner VIS communities, the use of visualizations for environmental storytelling, the environmental impact of the increasingly high use of machine learning in visualization applications, the role of new materials in physicalization among others. We especially welcome critical data and visualization perspectives on sustainability, such as Indigenous, ecofeminist, post-colonial, and post-humanist perspectives.

Submissions should be made [via PCS](https://new.precisionconference.com/).

Submission deadline: **July 12th, 2024**  
Notifications: **July 30, 2024**

## Example Topics

Considerations for sustainable visualization ecosystems:

- How might information visualization support sustainability goals such as environmental stewardship, climate resiliency, community health and wellness, housing, or food security?
- How has data visualization been used in citizen science or grassroots approaches to support sustainability efforts?
- How could designers consider people’s variable feelings and receptivity to environmental data-based communications?
- How do different people and communities define sustainability? And how should this be considered when visualizing data for sustainability?
- How could data visualization support sustainable data governance and environmental agency?
- What does it mean to design data visualization for the sustainability of communities of people?
- How might visualization be reimagined to accommodate a wide range of sustainability goals?

Considerations for sustainable data:

- What is/are sustainable data?
- How do different considerations of sustainability shape the data pipeline?
- Which data are prioritized for sustainability?
